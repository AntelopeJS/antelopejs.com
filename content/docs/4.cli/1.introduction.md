## Installation

The CLI is your main tool for working with Antelopejs. You can install it globally using your favorite package manager:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g @antelopejs/core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn global add @antelopejs/core
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -g @antelopejs/core
```

:::

This gives you the `ajs` command you can use anywhere on your system.

Don't want to install it globally? No problem. Just use npx: `npx @antelopejs/core <command>`
::

## Usage

Commands follow this simple pattern:

```bash
ajs <command> <subcommand> [options]
```

### Available Commands

| Command   | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| `project` | Create and manage projects |
| `module`  | Work with modules          |
| `config`  | Change CLI settings        |
| `help`    | Get help for commands      |

## Getting Help

Stuck on a command? Just add `--help` to see how to use it:

```bash
ajs project --help
ajs module init --help
```

## Configuration

The CLI remembers your settings in a config file. You can check or change these settings:

:::code-group

```bash [View Settings]
ajs config show
```

```bash [Change Settings]
ajs config set <key> <value>
```

:::

## Interface Repository

The CLI pulls from a Git repo called `interfaces` to get:

- Ready-to-use interfaces that follow best practices
- Project templates to get you started quickly
- Interface code you can add to your project

This repo is maintained by the community to ensure quality. If you need something custom, you can fork it and point the CLI to your version instead.
