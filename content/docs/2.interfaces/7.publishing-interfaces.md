## Overview

After creating a new interface or a new version of an existing interface, you need to publish it to make it available to other developers. This process involves updating the interface manifest in the git repository.

## Understanding interface manifests

Every interface in the AntelopeJS ecosystem has a manifest file (`manifest.json`) that defines its properties, versions, and implementations. This manifest is stored in the git repository under the `interfaces/<interface-name>/` directory.

::note
The manifest file is critical for the AntelopeJS CLI to discover and install your interface correctly. Based on this manifest information, the CLI creates the `.antelope/interfaces.d` directory inside your module, providing the necessary type definitions and install dependencies.
::

### Manifest structure

```json [manifest.json]
{
  "description": "A brief description of what the interface does",
  "versions": ["beta", "1"],
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "module-name",
      "source": {
        "type": "package",
        "package": "@organization/module-package",
        "version": "1.0.0"
      },
      "versions": ["beta", "1"]
    }
  ],
  "files": {
    "beta": {
      "type": "git",
      "remote": "git@github.com:Organization/interface-repo.git",
      "path": ".antelope/output/interface-name"
    },
    "1": {
      "type": "local",
      "path": "interfaces/interface-name/1"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "beta": {
      "packages": ["package-name@1.2.3"],
      "interfaces": ["other-interface@beta"]
    },
    "1": {
      "packages": ["package-name@2.0.0"],
      "interfaces": ["other-interface@1.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Key manifest properties

| Property       | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`  | Brief explanation of the interface's purpose            |
| `versions`     | Array of available interface versions                   |
| `modules`      | List of implementations for this interface              |
| `files`        | Location of interface definition files for each version |
| `dependencies` | Required packages and interfaces for each version       |

### File types for different versions

The `files` property in the manifest can specify two different types of sources for interface definition files:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "beta": {
      "type": "git",
      "remote": "git@github.com:Organization/interface-repo.git",
      "path": ".antelope/output/interface-name"
    },
    "1": {
      "type": "local",
      "path": "interfaces/interface-name/1"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "beta": {
      "packages": ["package-name@1.2.3"],
      "interfaces": ["other-interface@beta"]
    },
    "1": {
      "packages": ["package-name@2.0.0"],
      "interfaces": ["other-interface@1"]
    }
  }
}
```

::note

- **Git type**: Used for development (`dev`) and beta versions that are still evolving. This allows interface developers to easily update definition files in their own repository.
- **Local type**: Required for official/stable interface versions. With this type, the actual interface files must be committed to the interfaces repository, ensuring stability and availability.

::

For publishing an official interface version, you must:

1. Use the `local` type in the manifest
2. Include the interface definition files in the interfaces repository
3. Provide the relative path to these files in the manifest

This ensures that stable versions have all their files stored directly in the interfaces repository rather than depending on external repositories that might change. It also allows for proper code review of interface definitions before they become official, ensuring quality and consistency across the ecosystem.

## Creating or updating an interface manifest

::steps{level="4"}

#### Fork the interfaces repository

Create your own fork of the official interfaces repository.

#### Create the manifest file

Place your manifest file at `interfaces/<interface-name>/manifest.json` in your fork.

#### Generate interface definition files

Generate the interface definition files using the AntelopeJS CLI:

```bash
ajs module exports generate
```

This command analyzes your interface code and generates proper definition files in the `output` directory by default.

For different versions:

- **For dev/beta versions**: Keep the files in your implementation repository and reference them using the `git` type in the manifest
- **For official versions**: Copy the generated files to the interfaces repository at the appropriate location (e.g., `interfaces/<interface-name>/<version>`) and reference them using the `local` type in the manifest

#### Fill in all required fields

Ensure all required fields are populated correctly as described in the structure above.

#### Submit a pull request

Create a pull request to the main interfaces repository.

## Registering module implementations

If you've developed an alternative implementation of an existing interface, you need to update the manifest to include your module.

::tip
Registering your module in the manifest allows the CLI to discover and offer your implementation as an option when users add the interface to their projects.
::

Add your module to the `modules` array with:

```json
{
  "name": "your-module-name",
  "source": {
    "type": "package",
    "package": "@your-org/your-module-package",
    "version": "1.2.0"
  },
  "versions": ["beta", "1"]
}
```

## Interface version review process

The review process for interface versions varies depending on whether they are development, beta, or official versions:

flowchart TD
    A[Create New Interface Version] --> B{What Version?}
    B -->|dev/beta| C[No Formal Review Required]
    C --> E[Update Files in Your Repository]
    E --> F[Reference via 'git' Type in Manifest]
    F --> G[Can Be Modified Later]
    B -->|official| D[Requires Full Review]
    D --> H[Submit Files to Interfaces Repository]
    H --> I[Reference via 'local' Type in Manifest]
    I --> K[Submit Documentation]
    K --> J[Code Review Process]
    J --> L{Approved?}
    L -->|No| N[Revisions Needed]
    N --> J
    L -->|Yes| M[Merged to Main Branch]
    M --> O[Official Version Published]
    O --> P[Future Changes Require New Version]

    style C fill:#eeeeee
    style G fill:#d5f5e3
    style P fill:#d5f5e3
    style K fill:#d5e8f9
</Mermaid>

::note
Key points of this process:

- **dev/beta versions**: Quick iteration, no formal review, can be modified anytime
- **Official versions**: Must undergo code review, become immutable once published
- **Documentation requirement**: Official versions must include comprehensive documentation
- **Immutability principle**: Published official versions can never change, ensuring stability for developers

::

### Documentation requirements for official versions

When submitting an official version for review, you must include proper documentation:

- **For new interfaces**: Create a new documentation repository with comprehensive guides, examples, and API references
- **For new versions of existing interfaces**: Submit a PR to the interface's documentation repository with updated documentation that covers all changes and additions

Documentation should include:

- Interface purpose and key concepts
- API reference for all exported types and functions
- Example code demonstrating common use cases
- Migration guides when upgrading from previous versions

The documentation will be reviewed alongside the interface code as part of the approval process. Insufficient documentation may result in the version being rejected until proper documentation is provided.

If changes are needed after an official version is published, a new version must be created, following the same process.

## Configuring git interface repository

The AntelopeJS CLI uses a default git repository for interfaces, but you can configure it to use a different one. This is particularly useful in several scenarios:

::note{icon="i-ph-building-light"}
**Use cases for custom interface repositories:**

- Creating private interfaces for your organization
- Developing specialized interfaces for specific business needs
- Distributing interfaces to select developers without going through the official review process

::

::warning
When users install interfaces from non-official repositories, the CLI will display a warning that the interface doesn't come from the official repository. This indicates that the interface may not adhere to community quality standards or best practices.
::

### Setting a custom repository

To use your own interface repository as the default:

```bash
ajs config set git <repository-url>
```

### Using alternate repositories for specific interfaces

Developers can also import specific interfaces from alternate repositories without changing their default configuration:

```bash
ajs module imports add interface-name --git <repository-url>
```

### Viewing current configuration

To check which interface repository is currently being used:

```bash
ajs config get git
```

For more information on CLI configuration, see the [CLI configuration documentation](/docs/cli/config).

## Best practices

- Test your interface thoroughly before publishing
- Include comprehensive documentation for your interface
- Provide clear descriptions for interfaces and modules
- Properly specify all dependencies required by your interface
