## Philosophy

When we were looking for the right Node.js framework, we kept running into the same frustrating problems:

- Most frameworks pack too many features into their core, making them hard to customize
- Developers often need to rewrite their code just to get security updates and performance improvements
- There's usually no safe way to update parts of your app while it's running

Antelopejs fixes these headaches with its unique approach. We've built a system where modules talk to each other through well-defined interfaces, making upgrades much smoother.

## Key Features

What makes Antelopejs special? Here's what you'll love:

## Installation

::note{icon="i-ph-info"}
Before you start, make sure you have:

- Node.js v18.0.0 or newer
- A text editor (VS Code works great)
- Terminal access for running commands

::

First, install the Antelopejs CLI globally:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g @antelopejs/core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn global add @antelopejs/core
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -g @antelopejs/core
```

:::

Then create a new project:

```bash
ajs project init <project-name>
```

The CLI will walk you through setup, helping you pick templates and configure your modules.
::

## Next Steps

After creating your project, here's how to get started:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```

2. Ensure your antelope project dependencies are resolved:

   ```bash
   ajs project modules fix
   ```

3. Start your project:

   ```bash
   ajs project run -w
   ```
