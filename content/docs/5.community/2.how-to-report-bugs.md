## Reporting Bugs Effectively

Good bug reports help us fix problems faster. Here's how to submit one that gets results.

## Before You Report

### Bug or Question?

First, let's figure out what you're dealing with:

- **Need help using Antelopejs?** → Read [Getting help](1.getting-help.md)
- **Found something broken?** → You're in the right place

Not sure? Start a chat in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs/discussions). If it turns out to be a bug, we can always convert it to an issue.

### Check if It's Already Known

Save everyone some time:

1. Look through [open issues](https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs/issues) on GitHub
2. Browse [discussions](https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs/discussions) for similar problems
3. If someone already reported it, add your info to that thread instead

Try using exact error messages in your search. No luck? Try different words or phrases.

## Creating a Great Bug Report

A helpful bug report needs three things: how to recreate the problem, what happened, and details about your setup.

### 1. Create a Simple Test Case

The most helpful thing you can provide is a simple example that shows the bug:

1. Make a fresh project with just the basics
2. Add only the code needed to show the problem
3. Cut out anything unrelated
4. Write down exactly how to trigger the bug

The best examples:

- Focus on just one issue
- Include minimal code
- Are easy for us to run
- Show the problem every time

### 2. Share Your Setup

Tell us about your environment:

| Information          | How to Get It                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Antelopejs version   | Type `ajs --version`                 |
| Node.js version      | Type `node --version`                |
| Operating system     | What OS and version you're using     |
| Package manager      | npm, yarn, or pnpm (with version)    |
| Related dependencies | The important ones from package.json |

### 3. Tell Us What Happened

Clearly explain:

- What you were trying to do
- What you thought would happen
- What actually happened instead
- The exact error messages (text, not screenshots)
- Steps to make it happen again

## Submitting Your Report

Once you've got everything ready:

1. Head to [Antelopejs issues](https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Pick the "Bug Report" template
4. Fill in all the sections with your info
5. Include your test case or link to a repo
6. Add screenshots only if they really help explain the issue

## After You Report

After you submit:

- **Stay available** for questions we might have
- **Keep an eye on the issue** as we look into it
- **Try out fixes** when we release them
- **Be patient** as we work through all reported issues

## Security Issues

Found a security problem? That's different:

**Don't post security bugs publicly.** Instead, follow our [security policy](https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs/security/policy) to report them privately.
