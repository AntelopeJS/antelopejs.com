## Contributing to the Core Framework

The Antelopejs core framework is open-source and welcomes contributions from everyone. This guide will help you understand how to contribute specifically to the core framework components.

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.x or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- A code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository
# Visit https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs and click "Fork"

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/antelopejs.git
cd antelopejs

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
```

### Development Workflow

#### Testing Changes

We recommend a test-driven approach when developing new features or fixing bugs:

1. **Write tests first** to define expected behavior
2. **Implement your changes** to satisfy the tests
3. **Run the test suite** to verify functionality

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific tests
npm test -- -t "feature name"
```

#### Using the Playground

The repository includes a playground for manual testing:

1. Navigate to the `playground/` directory
2. Make adjustments to the example application
3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Verify your changes work as expected and all unit tests pass

#### Code Quality

Maintain high code quality by following these practices:

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Fix code style issues automatically
npm run lint:fix
```

## Core Design Principles

When modifying the framework, adhere to these guiding principles:

| Principle         | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modularity**    | Features should be self-contained with clear boundaries                   |
| **Compatibility** | Preserve backward compatibility unless there's a compelling reason not to |
| **Performance**   | New features shouldn't introduce significant overhead                     |
| **Simplicity**    | Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones                         |
| **Testability**   | All code should be thoroughly tested                                      |

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation is as important as code:

- **Code comments**: Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- **Documentation files**: Update relevant markdown files in `docs/`
- **Examples**: Include practical usage examples
- **Type definitions**: Keep TypeScript definitions accurate and complete

## Release Cycle

Antelopejs follows a structured release process:

1. **Development**: Features are built on feature branches
2. **Review**: Pull requests undergo code review
3. **Integration**: Approved changes are merged to main
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of integration
5. **Release**: Publishing to npm with semantic versioning
6. **Documentation**: Release notes and documentation updates
