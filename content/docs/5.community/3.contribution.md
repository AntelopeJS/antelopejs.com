## Contributing Guide

This guide will help you contribute to Antelopejs, whether you're a developer, writer, or community member.

## Ecosystem Overview

The Antelopejs ecosystem consists of two main repository groups:

| Organization                                | Purpose                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [antelopejs](https://github.com/antelopejs) | Core framework and official modules |

## Ways to Contribute

### Community Support

- Answer questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/antelopejs/antelopejs/discussions)
- Help with issue triage by reproducing reported bugs
- Share your solutions to common problems
- Provide feedback on new features and proposals

### Reporting Issues

Before creating a new issue:

1. For bugs, follow our [bug reporting guide](2.how-to-report-bugs.md)
2. For feature requests, check existing issues and discussions
3. Submit module-specific ideas to the relevant repository
4. For broader ideas, start a discussion in the Ideas section

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation is critical for user success:

- Fix typos or clarify existing content
- Add missing examples or code samples
- Improve organization or navigation
- Translate documentation to other languages

## Pull Request Process

### Before Starting

1. **Bug fixes**: Check if there's an existing issue
2. **Features**: Open a discussion first to align with project goals
3. **Documentation**: For typo fixes, consider combining multiple corrections

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name
4. Make changes following the code standards
5. Write tests for new features or bug fixes
6. Ensure all tests pass locally
7. Submit your pull request

### Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Common types include:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, no behavior changes, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- `vcs`: (version control system related, eg. git)
- `ci`: (continuous integration related, eg. github actions)
- `build`: (build system or external dependencies changes, eg. npm, yarn, build related bash scripts)
- `utils`: (scripts or tools around the project, eg. scripts to generate changelogs)

Examples:

```
feat(api): add support for custom headers
fix(auth): correct token validation logic
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Use a clear, descriptive title following commit conventions
- Reference related issues in the description (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Keep each PR focused on a single task or feature
- Respond promptly to reviewer feedback

## Creating Generic Interfaces

If you've built something useful with Antelopejs, consider turning it into a generic interface that others can implement:

### Why Create Generic Interfaces?

- **Ecosystem Growth**: Generic interfaces allow multiple implementations to flourish
- **Flexibility**: Users can switch between implementations based on their needs
- **Collaboration**: Different developers can focus on specific implementations
- **Standardization**: Establishes common patterns across the ecosystem

### From Feature to Interface

1. Identify functionality that could benefit from multiple implementations
2. Abstract the core behavior into a clear interface definition
3. Document the interface requirements thoroughly
4. Create a reference implementation as a module

### Interface Best Practices

- Keep interfaces focused on a single responsibility
- Design with future extensibility in mind
- Provide detailed type definitions
- Include example usage in documentation
- Reference related interfaces when appropriate

For detailed guidance, refer to our [Module documentation](../1.get-started/4.module.md) and [Export Interfaces](../2.interfaces/6.export-interfaces.md) guide.

## Proposing RFCs

For significant framework changes:

1. Start by implementing your idea as a module when possible
2. Open a discussion with code examples and rationale
3. If appropriate, your proposal will be marked as an RFC

RFC stages:

- `rfc: active` - Open for community feedback
- `rfc: approved` - Accepted by the core team
- `rfc: ready to implement` - Issue created for implementation
- `rfc: shipped` - Implemented in a release
- `rfc: archived` - Not approved but preserved for reference
